      "Making a broad generalisation about your experience or a situation. ”I always say the wrong thing.” Or saying things like ”Everyone” or ” Always”, or ”I never...”. ”Everything always goes bad for me.” Assuming all experiences and people are the same, bases on one negative experience."

      "You quickly give a global (e.g. negative) opinion about yourself, without considering whether this really is. Rather than focusing on the action, you turn it into a character flaw. So, rather than making a mistake, you label yourself as ”stupid”."

      "A sort of ”tunnel vision”: focusing on only one part of a situation and ignoring the rest. Usuualy this means looking at the negative parts of a situation and forgetting the positive parts (or vice versa),  and the whole picture is coloured by what may be a single (negative) detail."

You might be taking too much or too little responsability for the occurence of external events. You assume that everything people do is a response to you."

      "Believing that the way you feel accurate reflects reality. Basing your view of situations or yourself on the way you are feeling. For example, does feeling anxious really means something bad will happen? Does feeling ”blah” really means you are useless? ”I feel so stupid so it must be true.”"
