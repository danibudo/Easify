    "Taking a big breath in followed by a longer, slower breath out signals a state of relaxation to the bpdy and reduces stress. The longer exhales compared to the inhales help to slow doen heart rate and relax the nerves.",

    "Rhytmic deep bbreathing helps regulate body temperature and lower blood pressure. Holding your breath allows carbon dioxide to build up in the blood; releasing your breath then stimulates the body, helping you become more attentive and relaxed.",
    "Deep belly breathing helps force air buildup out of your lungs, which increases the amount of oxygen in your blood and strenghtens your diaphragm. This helps improve breathing, reduce stress, and restore energy."
